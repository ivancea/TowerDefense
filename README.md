# TowerDefense

New features *listed* in TODO.txt file.

Feel free to send your comments about new towers, new mechanics or some improvement!

If you want to test the game without compiling it, you can take the binary, map (.tdm), and resources at "bin/Release" **(For Windows)**

If you can't run it, you can try to contact me, but I can't guarantee I'll help you with portability problems or any other issue.
